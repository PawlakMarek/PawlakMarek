## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marek, an all-rounder self-taught IT Specialist.

I specialize in OS support (Linux, macOS, Windows), but have extensive experience with networking, self-hosting (Proxmox, docker), scripting/programming (C, C++, HTML, CSS, Python, Shell), and even some team leading and contract management.

First learned to code in the 90s, and came back and forth to programming multiple times for all these years.

I'm currently working on my tech habits and decided to come back to coding for longer.
Let's see if CodÃ©dex's #30NitesOfCode will help me with that.
